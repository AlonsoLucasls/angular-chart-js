# AngularChartJs

App created to help the Angular community that needs to start building Charts with Angular, you can use this project as a base project.

If you prefer to use the real time data (fake data) in the "main" and "feature/chart-signalr" branch you will need to run this API [Chart API](https://github.com/AlonsoLucasls/chart-api) created and configured with SignalR.
Remember to check program.cs to make some adjustments if needed.

Using the branch "feature/chart-random-call" you don't need to run the [Chart API](https://github.com/AlonsoLucasls/chart-api) because everything is made on front-end.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.3.0, Chart.js version 3.7.1 and ng2-charts version 3.0.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
